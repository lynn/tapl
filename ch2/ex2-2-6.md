Given a relation R on a set S, and R′ = R ∪ {(s, s) ∣ s ∈ S}, we are to prove that R′ is the “reflexive closure” of R.

It is clear that R ⊆ R′. Also, for any reflexive R″ such that R ⊆ R″, we have also {(s, s) ∣ s ∈ S} ⊆ R″ (because it is reflexive), so that the union (R ∪ {(s, s) ∣ s ∈ S}) = R′ is yet another subset of R″. This means R′ is the _smallest_ reflexive relation containing R in the sense of Definition 2.2.5, and R′ is the reflexive closure of R.
